Important Notes:
Currently, the testing is being done on the dataset we were using previously! After the full setup, it will take a very small amount of time to change it for the actual dataset. 

CSV_Reader is working in its basic functionality just to visualize the output in a terminal, depending on Dashboard designs, we can modify this! 

Outlier_Detection is working fine with giving a number of potential outliers from the data provided, it doesn't show which data is faulty, however, the work for that is under progress!
